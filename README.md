# Project name: Zero Player Game (ZPG)

## Title: Merging Realities

**1: Project overview**

**_ZPG project description:_**
ZPG (Zero Player Game) is a unique text-based online game based on Python and Django. It is based on the idea of creating a virtual world where players can observe the self-development of characters with artificial intelligence. The main feature of ZPG is that players do not need to participate in the game directly - their characters act autonomously.

**_Project idea and goal:_**
The goal of the ZPG project is to create a unique interactive experience for players, where their characters develop and make decisions using artificial intelligence. The idea arose from the desire to explore a new approach to creating games where players can observe the lives of characters without direct participation. The main goal is to provide players with a unique experience where their characters react to events in the game on their own and develop based on their own intelligence.

**2: Problem it solves:**

ZPG solves several problems and challenges related to the creation of online text games and artificial intelligence.

1. A new approach to gaming: The project provides an innovative and exciting approach to gameplay, offering players a unique experience where they can only watch autonomous characters interact with the game on their own.

2. Character Self-Development: With the help of artificial intelligence, the characters of the game can independently develop based on their internal logic mechanism.

3. Studying Artificial Intelligence: The project is an experimental platform for exploring the possibilities of artificial intelligence and its application in creating text games with autonomous characters.

4. Interactive experience for players: ZPG gives players a chance to explore the virtual world and watch their own characters react to events and situations that occur in the game.

5. The general idea of a ZPG is to help players live a unique experience in a text-based virtual world where artificial intelligence allows characters to develop independently, solve problems, and interact with other characters.

**3: Game description**

**_Basic principles of the game:_**

- ZPG is a text-based online game with autonomous characters that have artificial intelligence.

- Players register in the game and create their own characters, choosing one of the options for character development from among the proposed ones.

- Once a character is created, players become observers rather than participants in the game, and the characters begin to interact with the virtual world autonomously.

**_Gameplay and game mechanics:_**

- The game is based on text messages and dialogues between characters and internal artificial intelligence systems.

- Characters can meet other game characters, animals and monsters, and interact with them, making decisions based on their abilities and characteristics.

- Each character has internal logic scripts that determine their behavior and reactions to different situations. These scripts are based on artificial intelligence algorithms and self-learning.

- The character's development is determined by his or her intelligence, abilities, experience, and knowledge gained during the game.

- Events and situations in the game are generated dynamically, depending on the actions of the characters and other factors in the game, which creates a unique experience for each player.

The main idea of the gameplay is to create a unique experience where players can watch the self-development of characters that have their own intelligence and abilities. The gameplay develops without the player's direct influence, but every decision of the character has an impact on its further development and interaction with the virtual world.

**4: The architecture of artificial intelligence**

**_Description of the artificial intelligence algorithms used in the project:_**

1. This algorithm is used to teach characters in the game to learn. Characters are rewarded or punished depending on their actions, which helps them determine the most optimal strategies and behaviors.

2. Genetic algorithms: They are used for the evolutionary development of characters. Mutations and the selection of the best character variants are applied, which helps to improve their characteristics and abilities.

3. Neural Networks: Used to model character intelligence and decision-making. Neural networks help characters learn dependencies and patterns that appear in the game and interact with other characters.

**_The logic of the character model and its self-learning:_**

1. Initial parameters: When creating a character, initial parameters, characteristics, and abilities are set. These parameters determine the behavior of the character at the beginning of the game.

2. Interaction with the world around you: After creating characters, they begin to interact with the world around them and other characters. Their actions and decisions affect the events and situations that occur in the game.

3. Rewards and punishments: For each action, the character receives a reward or punishment depending on its consequences. This information helps the character to determine the best actions in the future.

4. After receiving rewards and punishments, characters analyze their actions and draw conclusions. They use artificial intelligence algorithms to self-learn and improve their strategy.

This approach to character logic allows them to create unique patterns of behavior, depending on the actions and decisions made in the game. In this way, characters can develop and make decisions independently, creating a unique and engaging game experience for each player.

**5: Project artifacts**

**_Character creation system:_**

- Users have the opportunity to create their own unique characters by choosing one of the proposed development options.

- The system provides a wide range of characteristics, abilities, and properties that affect the further development of the character.

- Players can create several characters with different characteristics, exploring different game strategies.

**_Logic scripts for character behavior:_**

- Each character has its own internal logic scripts that determine its behavior and reactions to different situations.

- The scripts are based on artificial intelligence algorithms and take into account the characteristics and abilities of the character.

- Logic scripts allow characters to make decisions and interact with the virtual world based on their own intelligence.

**_An artificial intelligence system for animals and monsters:_**

- Animals and monsters in the game also have their own artificial intelligence system that determines their behavior and interaction with characters and other objects.

- Their behavior is also based on logical scripts and algorithms, which allows them to react to the actions of players and characters in the game.

**_A mechanism for generating events and situations in the game:_**

- The game has a mechanism for the dynamic generation of events and situations that occur in the virtual world.

- This mechanism allows you to create a unique game experience for each player, depending on the actions and decisions of the characters, animals, and monsters in the game.

These artifacts are key components of the ZPG project that help to provide a unique and immersive experience for each player. Character creation systems, logic scripts, artificial intelligence for animals and monsters, and an event generation engine make the game dynamic, diverse, and interesting for players of all experience levels.
